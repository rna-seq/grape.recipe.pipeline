grape.recipe.pipeline
=====================

Grape (Grape RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline Environment) is a pipeline for processing
and analyzing RNA-Seq data developed at the Bioinformatics and Genomics unit of
the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG) in Barcelona. 

The grape.buildout packages makes use of the grape.recipe.pipeline recipe
to configure Grape pipelines. You get preconfigured start and execute scripts, 
and don't have to worry about command line options any more. This takes the pain
out of configuring multiple Grape pipelines.

To learn more about Grape, and to download and install it, go to the Bioinformatics
